# Optimizing Ensemble Learning

This is a part of my undergraduate thesis that aimed to explore and optimize ensemble learning techniques to determine the most effective ensemble algorithm for a given dataset. By leveraging multiple base models and various ensemble strategies i tried to evaluate different ensemble approaches, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and hybrid methods, to achieve the best possible predictive performance based on a metric called F2.
